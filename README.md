HEY VSAUCE, MICHAEL HERE

In all seriousness, this is going to be a Discord Bot with some capabilities including:
  - Streaming Vsauce background music (Jake Chudnow)
  - Randomly posting "Hey Vsauce, Michael Here!" In the channel
  - Updates on Vsauce video (RSS feeds perhaps)
  - and many more...
  
  This is a small project put together by Cosmos and yours truly. Come swing by at the Tatsumaki Discord to chat or two!
