HEY VSAUCE, MICHAEL HERE

The point of this bot is to create a fun loving bot for all Vsauce fans/Jake Chudnow's music fans.
This is a summer project! Started by Cosmos and Yours Truly. Find us on the Tatsumaki Support Discord Channel if you know where that is ;)

We're looking to create:

  - Streaming Vsauce instrumental music 
  - Random posts into chat going 'Hey Vsauce! Michael here!'
  - Updates on every new videos (aka RSS)
